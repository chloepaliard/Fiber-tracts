# Fiber-tracts

Here is a project that 3 friends and I worked on with a PhD student, to help him in his research work. We had two weeks to work on it and it enabled us to discover the C++ language and OpenGL.

The idea was to manipulate a 3D modelisation of fiber tracts from the brain and to make it easier to navigate through it. This was done by joining fiber tracts that were close enough. This simplification makes the modelisation easier for a surgeon to go through, without losing any important information about the brain fiber tracts.

I'll let you have a look at it now !
